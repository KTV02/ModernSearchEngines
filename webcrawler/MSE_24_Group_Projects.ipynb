It is situated 30 km (19 mi) south of the state capital, Stuttgart , and developed on both sides of the Neckar and Ammer rivers. As of 2014 [update] [3] about one in three of the 90,000 people [ citation needed ] living in Tübingen is a student. As of the 2018/2019 winter semester, 27,665 students attend the Eberhard Karl University of Tübingen . [ citation needed ] The city has the lowest median age in Germany, in part due to its status as a university city. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of a citizen of Tübingen is 39.1 years. [ citation needed ] Immediately north of the city lies the Schönbuch , a densely wooded nature park . The Swabian Alb mountains rise about 13 km (8 mi) (beeline Tübingen City to Roßberg - 869 m) to the southeast of Tübingen. The Ammer and Steinlach rivers are tributaries of the Neckar river, which flows in an easterly direction through the city, just south of the medieval old town . Large parts of the city are hilly, with the Schlossberg and the Österberg in the city centre and the Schnarrenberg and Herrlesberg, among others, rising immediately adjacent to the inner city. The highest point is at about 500 m (1,640.42 ft) above sea level near Bebenhausen in the Schönbuch forest, while the lowest point is 305 m (1,000.66 ft) in the city's eastern Neckar valley. The geographical centre of the state of Baden-Württemberg is in a small forest called Elysium, near the Botanical Gardens of the city's university. History [ edit ] Further information: County Palatine of Tübingen The area was probably first settled by ancient humans in the 12th millennium BC. The Romans left some traces here in AD 85, when they built a limes frontier wall at the Neckar River. Tübingen dates from the 6th or 7th century, when the region was populated by the Alamanni people. Some historians argue that the Battle of Solicinium was fought at Spitzberg , a mountain in Tübingen, in AD 367, although there is no evidence for this. [ citation needed ] Tübingen first appears in official records in 1191. The local castle, Hohentübingen , has records going back to 1078, when it was besieged by Henry IV , king of Germany . Its name was transcribed in Medieval Latin as Tuingia and Twingia . From 1146, Count Hugo V (1125–52) was promoted to count palatine as Hugo I. Tübingen was established as the capital of a County Palatine of Tübingen . By 1231, Tübingen was a civitas , indicating recognition by the Crown of civil liberties and a court system. In 1262, an Augustinian monastery was established by Pope Alexander IV in Tübingen; in 1272, a Franciscan monastery was founded. In 1300, a Latin school (today's Uhland-Gymnasium) was founded. During the Protestant Reformation, which Duke Ulrich of Württemberg converted to, he disestablished the Franciscan monastery in 1535. In 1342, the county palatine was sold to Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg and incorporated into the County of Württemberg . Tübingen, Neckarfront Shops lining the city square Between 1470 and 1483, St. George's Collegiate Church was built. The collegiate church offices provided the opportunity for what soon afterwards became the most significant event in Tübingen's history: the founding of the Eberhard Karls University by Duke Eberhard im Bart of Württemberg in 1477, thus making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It became soon renowned as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire , especially for theology (a Protestant faculty, Tübinger Stift , was established in 1535 in the former Augustinian monastery). Today, the university is still the biggest source of income for the residents of the city and one of the biggest universities in Germany with more than 26,000 students. Between 1622 and 1625, the Catholic League occupied Lutheran Württemberg in the course of the Thirty Years' War . In the summer of 1631, the city was raided. In 1635/36 the city was hit by the Plague . In 1638, Swedish troops conquered Tübingen. Towards the end of the war, French troops occupied the city from 1647 until 1649. In 1789, parts of the old town burned down, but were later rebuilt in the original style. In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung , a leading newspaper in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen by Johann Friedrich Cotta . From 1807 until 1843, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin lived in Tübingen in a tower overlooking the Neckar. In the Nazi era, the Tübingen Synagogue was burned in the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938. The Second World War left the city largely unscathed, mainly because of the peace initiative of a local doctor, Theodor Dobler . It was occupied by the French army and became part of the French zone of occupation. From 1946 to 1952, Tübingen was the capital of the newly formed state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern (as French : Tubingue ), before the state of Baden-Württemberg was created by merging Baden , Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The French troops had a garrison stationed in the south of the city until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s. In the 1960s, Tübingen was one of the centres of the German student movement and the Protests of 1968 and has ever since shaped left and green political views. Some radicalized Tübingen students supported the leftist Rote Armee Fraktion terrorist group, with active member Gudrun Ensslin , a local and a Tübingen student from 1960 to 1963, joining the group in 1968. On May 27, 1968, the first ever automated teller machine in Germany was installed in Tübingen, into the wall of the local community bank Kreissparkasse Tübingen, built by Aalen -based safe builder Ostertag AG in cooperation with AEG-Telefunken . It was made available to use for 1000 selected clients of the bank. [4] [5] Although noticing such things today is largely impossible, as recently as the 1950s, Tübingen was a very socioeconomically divided city, with poor local farmers and tradesmen living along the Stadtgraben (City Canal) and students and academics residing around the Alte Aula and the Burse , the old university buildings. There, hanging on the Cottahaus , a sign commemorates Goethe's stay of a few weeks while visiting his publisher. The German tendency to memorialize every minor presence of its historical greats (comparable to the statement \" Washington slept here\" in the United States) is parodied on the building next door. This simple building, once a dormitory, features a plain sign with the words \"Hier kotzte Goethe\" (lit.: \" Goethe puked here\"). In the second half of the 20th century, Tübingen's administrative area was extended beyond what is now called the \"core city\" to include several outlying small towns and villages. Most notable among these is Bebenhausen , a village clustered around a castle and Bebenhausen Abbey , a Cistercian cloister about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Tübingen. Overview [ edit ] In 2020 [update] , the city had 90,000 inhabitants. Life in the city is dominated by its roughly 28,000 students. Tübingen is best described as a mixture of old and distinguished academic flair, including liberal and green politics on one hand and traditional German-style student fraternities on the other, with rural - agricultural environs and shaped by typical Lutheran - Pietist characteristics, such as austerity and a Protestant work ethic , and traditional Swabian elements, such as frugality , order , and tidiness. The city is home to many picturesque buildings from previous centuries and lies on the River Neckar. In 1995 [update] , the German weekly magazine Focus published a national survey, according to which Tübingen had the highest quality of life of all cities in Germany. Factors taken into consideration included the infrastructure, the integration of bicycle lanes into the road system, a bus system connecting surrounding hills and valleys, late-night services, areas of the city that can be reached on foot, the pedestrianised old town, and other amenities and cultural events offered by the university. Tübingen is the city with the youngest average population in Germany. Main sights [ edit ] View from the tower of Stiftskirche In central Tübingen, the Neckar divides briefly into two streams, forming the elongated Neckarinsel (Neckar Island), famous for its Platanenallee with high plane trees , which are around 200 years old. Pedestrians can reach the island via stairs on the narrow ends leading down from a bridge spanning the Neckar, and by a smaller foot bridge nearer the middle of the island. During the summer, the Neckarinsel is occasionally the venue for concerts, plays, and literary readings. The row of historical houses across one side of the elongated Neckarinsel is called the Neckarfront and includes the house with adjoining tower where poet Friedrich Hölderlin stayed for the last 36 years of his life, as he struggled with mental instability. Tübingen city hall Neckar and Hölderlinturm Stiftskirche Tübingen street art near Blaue Brücke Tübingen's Altstadt (old town) survived World War II due to the city's lack of heavy industry. The result is a growing domestic tourism business as visitors come to wander through one of the few completely intact historic Altstädte in Germany. The highlights of Tübingen include its crooked cobblestone lanes, narrow-stair alleyways picking their way through the hilly terrain, streets lined with canals, and well-maintained traditional half-timbered houses. Old city landmarks include the city hall on Markt Square and the Hohentübingen Castle, now part of the University of Tübingen. The central landmark is the Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Along with the rest of the city, the Stiftskirche was one of the first to convert to Martin Luther 's protestant church. As such, it maintains (and carefully defends) several \" Roman Catholic \" features, such as patron saints . Below the Rathaus is a quiet, residential street called the Judengasse , the former Jewish neighborhood of Tübingen until the city's Jews were expelled in 1477. On the street corner is a plaque commemorating the fate of Tübingen's Jews . The centre of Tübingen is the site of weekly and seasonal events, including regular market days on the Holzmarkt by the Stiftskirche and the Marktplatz by the Rathaus, an outdoor cinema in winter and summer, festive autumn and Christmas markets and (formerly) Europe's largest Afro-Brazilian festival. Students and tourists also come to the Neckar River in the summer to visit beer gardens or go boating in Stocherkähne , the Tübingen equivalent of Oxford and Cambridge punts , only slimmer. A Stocherkahn carries up to 20 people. On the second Thursday of June, all Stocherkahn punts take part in a major race, the Stocherkahnrennen . Bebenhausen Abbey lies in the village of Bebenhausen, a district of Tübingen. A subdivision of the pilgrimage route known as the Way of St. James starts here and runs through Tübingen. Government [ edit ] Tübingen is governed by the mayor, elected by citizens every eight years, and by the municipal council, elected by citizens every five years. [6] Boris Palmer , a former member of the Greens , has been mayor since 2007, re-elected in 2014 and 2022 and on his third term until 2030. [7] Tübingen's council decided that the city should be climate-neutral by 2030. [8] [9] In 2022, the city was the first in Germany to tax disposable food packaging . [10] Restaurants in Tübingen are charged 50 cents per disposable cup and cardboard bowl, and 20 cents per piece of cutlery. [11] Regional structure [ edit ] Tübingen (lower right) on the Neckar, in southwest Germany Tübingen is the capital of an eponymous district and an eponymous administrative region ( Regierungsbezirk ) , before 1973 called Südwürttemberg-Hohenzollern . Tübingen is, with nearby Reutlingen (about 15 km (9.3 mi) east), one of the two centre cities of the Neckar-Alb region. Administratively, it is not part of the Stuttgart Region , bordering it to the north and west ( Böblingen district ). However, the city and northern parts of its district can be regarded as belonging to that region in a wider regional and cultural context. Districts [ edit ] Tübingen is divided into 22 districts, the city core of twelve districts (population of about 51,000) and ten outer districts (suburbs) (population of about 31,000): Core city districts: Französisches Viertel Österberg Schönblick/Winkelwiese Lustnau Südstadt Universität Waldhäuser Ost Wanne Weststadt Zentrum Outer districts: Ammerbuch Bebenhausen Bühl Derendingen Hagelloch Hirschau Kilchberg Pfrondorf Unterjesingen Weilheim, Baden-Württemberg Culture [ edit ] Tübingen has a notable arts culture as well as nightlife. In addition to the full roster of official and unofficial university events that range from presentations by the university's official poet in residence to parties hosted by the student associations of each faculty, the city can boast of several choirs, theatre companies and nightclubs. Also, Tübingen's Kunsthalle (art exhibition hall), on the \"Wanne\", houses two or three exhibits of international note each year. Events [ edit ] There are several festivals, open air markets and other events on a regular basis: January Arab Movie Festival Arabisches Filmfestival April Latin American Movie Festival CineLatino (usually in April or May) May Internationales Pianisten-Festival (international festival of pianists) Rock Festival Rock im Tunnel (usually in May or June) June A Stocherkahn ( punt ) Stocherkahn boats during a race Poled boat race ( German : Stocherkahnrennen ), second Thursday of June, 2pm, around the Neckar Island Ract!festival , an alternative open air festival for free with music performances and workshops Tübinger Wassermusik : concerts on Stocherkahn boats July Stadtfest : gastronomy and performances in the streets of the old town Tübinger Sommerinsel festival: various restaurants serving special meals and associations offering activities on the Neckar Island August Tübinger Orgelsommer : organ concerts in the Stiftskirche Sommerkonzerte in the former monastery of Bebenhausen (July-September) Kennen Sie Tübingen?

Currently, Lord Mayor Boris Palmer (Green Party) has set the ambitious goal of increasing the population of Tübingen to 100,000 within the next several years. To achieve this, the city is closing gaps between buildings within the city proper by allowing new houses to be built there; this is also to counter the tendency of urban sprawl and land consumption that has been endangering the preservation of rural landscapes of Southern Germany.

Active cultural and political exchange take place between the towns and communities in Tübingen's sister cities. There are many contact points for a lively exchange, ranging from official visits to cooperation between schools and universities, performances, collective projects in culture and economy as well as private contacts. Aigle, Switzerland On October 12th, 1973 a partnership contract was signed between Tübingen and the town of Aigle in Suisse romande (canton Vaud). The two communities had been in close contact through exchange programs between Kepler Gymnasium in Tübingen and the Collège d'Aigle before the contract. Several associations and clubs, as well as reciprocal visits of official delegations and of the municipal councils, contribute to the good relationship. In July 2003, on the occasion of the town fair in Tübingen, the 30th anniversary of the partnership was celebrated. Aix-en-Provence, France Since October 20th, 1960 the university towns of Tübingen and Aix-en-Provence have had a partnership. In 1965 Aix-en-Provence and Tübingen received jointly for their activities the Europe Prize. With a multitude of exchange programs, the close relationship of the universities, joint cultural projects and reciprocal visits of merchants on traditional markets (gastronomic specialties, arts and crafts) the mutual interest is still alive and well even after more than 40 years. Ann Arbor, USA The town Ann Arbor in Michigan was co-founded by Swabian emigrants in 1824. It created an official partnership with the university town of Tübingen on November 17th 1965. The \"Amerika-Haus\" in Tübingen (d.a.i.) and the Association of Ann Arbor Swabians were very active in their support to bring this about. An exchange program has been offered to all pupils in Tübingen every two years since 1987. Reciprocal visits and a lively exchange among artists cultivate the relationship. Durham, England The partnership with Durham County in England has existed since 1969. The impulse was given by the Kepler-Gymnasium in Tübingen, who organized an exchange program for teenagers, and through which young people from County Durham come to Tübingen and vice versa every year. The Carlo-Schmid-Gymnasium has also maintained an internal school exchange for decades; a multitude of associations, clubs and orchestras support the friendship as well. New technology has been established in Durham since 1993 which offers the chance to transfer technologies between the two partner towns. Kilchberg, Switzerland The partnership between the Tübingen-Kilchberg district and Kilchberg near Zürich was established in 1956 and signed 25 years later in 1981. Every year there are meetings between the administrations, the fire departments and the clubs. Private relationships and friendships enhance the good rapport. Alternating each year there is an exchange for teenagers over the holidays. Kingersheim, France In 1959 the two former mayors of the communities of Hirschau and Kingersheim (Alsace) got to know each other. In 1963, after intense discussions, both mayors were able to convince their municipal councils and citizens that reconciliation between the French and the Germans could best be promoted by partnerships on a communal level. In this belief the signing of the contract took place in a ceremony on September 14, 1963. Since then there has been an active partnership between the two communities on a municipal and private basis, as well as between different associations and clubs. Monthey, Switzerland Two Swiss authors founded the International Mayors Union near Vevey at Lake Geneva and within this framework Tübingen and Monthey had contact for the first time. On June 14, 1959 the partnership was officially sealed. Programs for pupils' exchange, official delegations, reciprocal visits of artists, collective exhibitions and concerts continue the close alliance until today. Perugia, Italy Numerous amicable relationships, inter alia by common partner town Aix-en-Provence, led Tübingen and Perugia to become sister cities on June 21st, 1984. Since then many pupils, associations and sports clubs, artists and deputies of the municipal councils and municipalities visit each other with unbroken interest. Since 1996 Perugia's merchants and cultural groups have added the Italian touch to the Umbrian-Provencal Market. Petrosawodsk, Russia In 1987 the municipal council of Tübingen decided on a twin town of comparability in the then Soviet Union; in October 1989 the sister cities was founded with Petrosawodsk in Karelia and the links were official. The relationship lives from long standing contacts on various levels and last but not least from the willingness to accept the sometimes long and troublesome journey. Villa El Salvador, Peru On 24 September 2006, Mayor Jaime Zea Usca and Lord Mayor Brigitte Russ-Scherer both signed the document which seals the sistercityship between the City of Villa El Salvador and the City of Tübingen. In December 2005, the Tübingen City Council had decided on this sistercityship. Its long-term aims are cultural and political exchange, understanding among nations, active peacework and growing relations between volunteers in both cities.

In 1078 Tübingen was mentioned in writing for the first time, and in the middle of the 13th century Tübingen achieved town status and civil liberty under the Palatine Counts of Tübingen. The city arms show the tripartite banner of the Palatine Counts; around 1514 the deer antlers of Württemberg were added. Towards the end of the 15th century Count Eberhard im Barte founded the university with the slogan \"attempto\" (I will attempt it).

The university was set the cornerstone for numerous great careers, and has itself been molded and enriched by the subsequent activities and events. Since 1868, the university town has awarded honory citizenship to people who have brought the town prosperity and esteem; it is the highest acknowledgement a community can enunciate. In 2002 on the occasion of the 525th anniversary of the Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen, this award was given to the Nobel prize winner Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, to the man of letters Walter Jens and to the theologian and co-founder of the Global Ethics Foundation Hans Küng.
