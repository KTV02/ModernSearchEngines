# Problems

## NLP Processing
language detection (partially english /german)

## Crawling

### ip blocking
- 403 responses from e.g. wikipedia =>cdn?

### dynamically loaded content
- How to transform JS scripted pages into NLP digestable documents

### "Refilling" frontier
- Which outgoing links should be added to frontier?
- Option A: Hard string matching (e.g. Tuebingen)
    - Problem: Probably too narrow definition
    - Not all topically relevant URLs contain some form of Tuebingen, t%c3%bcbingen, etc. in URL
- Option B: Add all now, filter later
    - Add all outgoing absolute links to frontier first
    - Do filtering after making request and parsing HTML
    - Problem: Explodes frontier and possibly index
